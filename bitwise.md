# Bitwise operations 

- AND & sets bits to 1 only if both bits are 1, bit disjoint is equal to 0 
    - 5 & 3 -> 101 & 011 -> 111
- OR | sets bits to 1 if at least 1 bit is 1
    - 5 | 3 -> 101 | 011 -> 111
- XOR ^ sets
    - 5 ^ 3 -> 101 ^ 011 -> 110
- Left_shift << Moves bits to the left multiplying by 2^n
    - 5 << 1 -> 101 -> 1010
- Right_shift >> Moves bits to the right dividing by 2^n
    - 5 >> 1 -> 101 -> 10
